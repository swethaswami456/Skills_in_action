Common beginner confusion 😄

**No, `.js` does not mean Java.** It means **JavaScript**.

Although the names sound similar, **Java and JavaScript are completely different languages**.

### Java

Files:

```text
HelloWorld.java
```

Example:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
```

Used for:

* Enterprise applications
* Android development (historically)
* Backend services
* Banking systems

***

### JavaScript

Files:

```text
script.js
app.js
```

Example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello");
```

Used for:

* Websites
* React applications
* Web apps
* Backend with Node.js

***

### Why are the names so similar?

In the 1990s, Java was extremely popular. Netscape created JavaScript and gave it a similar name for marketing reasons.

Despite the name:

```text
Java ≠ JavaScript
```

It's similar to:

```text
Car ≠ Carpet
```

The names look related, but they are different things.

### React Uses JavaScript

When you create a React app, you'll commonly see:

```text
App.js
Header.js
Navbar.js
```

or in newer projects:

```text
App.jsx
Header.jsx
Navbar.jsx
```

Example React component:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello Swetha!</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

That's JavaScript (with JSX syntax), not Java.

### Quick Comparison

| Java              | JavaScript                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `.java` files     | `.js` files                    |
| Compiled language | Interpreted/transpiled for web |
| Runs on JVM       | Runs in browsers and Node.js   |
| Spring Boot       | React, Angular, Vue            |
| Backend focused   | Frontend and backend           |

For web development and React, you'll mainly learn:

```text
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React
```

You do **not** need to learn Java to build React websites. In fact, many React developers have never written Java.


```
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
